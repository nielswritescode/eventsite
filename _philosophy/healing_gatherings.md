Similarly to trying to give a comprehensive definition for 'unconditional' organizing, trying to define what *healing* is is out of scope for this project.
It is safe to say that what healing is, is highly context-dependent.

We believe that the greatest insight we currently have on healing lies in collective trauma theories.
Therefore, we think integrated gatherings with a focus on connection & authenticity are the main target of TIDSUO.
However, anything could be a healing gathering. It really is context-dependent.

Examples being:

> Meditating with your neighbors.

> Authentic relating practices.

> Forest yoga classes.

But consider also:

> A 'fun' event like improvisation theater for a community that lacks fun.

> Something incredibly simple like a picknick with the intention to talk about a connecting subject.

> A nature festival for a thousand people.
