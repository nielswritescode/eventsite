Decommercialization is a broad term. It refers to the general concept of moving away from profit-driven practices to ones that are more socially responsible. For this project, we are looking at a vision of total decommercialization. 

## Total decommercialization
A vision where the gathering has no connection to the capitalistic system at all. There is no expectation of reciprocity, nor equity for the organizer(s). This is a very different mindset when compared to donation-based events. And it is important to keep in mind that when doing concessions to integrate a gathering hosted in the spirit of this vision there is a line. And when that line is crossed (by doing too many concessions), it will no longer be a gathering that is hosted under this vision. 

To what extent can gatherings be hosted under total decommercialization in our society?
