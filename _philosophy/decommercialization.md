Decommercialization is a broad term. It refers to the general concept of moving away from profit-driven practices to ones that are more socially responsible.

## Actual examples of decommercialization
Decommercialization of healing gatherings is not a new concept; many structures have been invented to this purpose and are actively being used at the moment. Examples being:

- 'Burn' events
- Gatherings where the participants solely share the cost of the space
- Donation-based events
- Option to work something out for those with limited financial means
- Helping out at the event directly as a payment to join
- Trading services for services (i.e. trading a massage for a somatic session)
- Grassroots organizing

## Total decommercialization
For this project, we are looking at a vision of total decommercialization. A vision where the gathering has no connection to the capitalistic system at all. There is no expectation of reciprocity, nor equity for the organizer(s). This is a very different mindset compared to the examples listed above. And it is important to keep in mind that when doing concessions to integrate a gathering hosted in the spirit of this vision there is a line. And when that line is crossed (by doing too many concessions), it will no longer be a gathering that is hosted under this vision. Experience will show to what extent this vision can be integrated into gatherings.
