## What do Wemean by this?

This event is free of charge, which means that:

- Wedo not charge an entry fee.
- There is no implicit expectation for a donation.

## Why is it free?

Webelieve that, when money gets involved, something inherently changes about the spiritual nature of the event. Wecould write an entire book about what that exactly is, but in order to gain enough insight to write that book, I'd need to organize many events first. 

I'll leave these 3 questions here instead:

- Would it be possible to organize events from a place of giving unconditionally?
- To what degree does your experience of an event change when there is an entry fee?
- Is there a possibility for an entirely different philosophy behind event organization?

## What are you receiving exactly?

So, first of all, this is not meant to gaslight anyone into contributing. It is merely meant to get an understanding of what it takes to 
organize. You are receiving it unconditionally and you are worth it.

The amount of time and energy it takes to organize an event is commonly underestimated. Wehave ocasionally spent over 70 hours on a 2-hour workhop.

For me, organizing an event requires:

- Maintaining an active network of people
- Promoting the event
- Keeping up my own practice for anything Weteach
- Investing financially in spaces
- Arranging transport for people, props & prerequisites
- Learn various challenging social and spiritual skills due to the innovative nature of my events
- Keeping up the IT infrastructure
- Preparing the event: writing, meetings, practice etc.
- Making tea & otherwise create a comfortable atmosphere for participants
- Dealing with edge-cases, no-shows and practical issues
- The list goes on...

## How to contribute

There is no expectation to contribute. Nor is it dependent on your (financial) situation. You're welcome to not do so your entire life. 

However, if you attended one of my events, and you have found a place of unconditional giving in yourself. You could support us by: 

- A financial contribution in cash
- Sharing your top 3 skills for us to call upon
*Perhaps you're good at cleaning and you would like to clean at our home. You're a massage therapist and can give us a session. You can give us a free ticket to your spiritual event. You have a car and can offer transport. You can teach us a useful skill. You're good at fixing bikes and are willing to fix mine. There are so many options.*
- Helping out with events directly. Promotion, spaceholding or other organizational tasks.
- Your creative idea on how to support us or our mission.

## F.A.Q.

### Why do you not just ask for donations?
Wethink that setting the price for the event to any type of donation (sliding scale, free choice, recommended price) creates 
an expectation to donate which will influence the space. I'm attempting to create the reverse experience. The event is given, 
and any donations helps us to balance out the amount of energy we invest. 

### Is there an option to donate online?
As of now, no. We don't want to get involved with platform fees and registered transactions as of now. This will push us towards
becoming an official organization which will once again push the philosophy towards commercialization. We could imagine making some 
sort of non-profit sister organization in the background to handle the official stuff, but that's a long way from now. If you absolutely
want to donate online we could send you our bank account details.
