This section is part of a practical *sulfur* framework. It is meant as an example to the *sulfur* theory.

Gatherings always have a cost type, such as free, paid, or donation-based. *Sulfur* needs a new cost type. We propose the name *Unconditionally Given* and set some guidelines for this cost type.

### Guidelines
- There is no entry fee for the gathering.

> If there is an entry fee, that will be a very obvious condition for entering the event.

- There is no implicit expectation for a donation

> Writing something like "Donations are welcome!" in the event description will alter the energy of the space. The event was not unconditionally given. People might feel ashamed if they do not donate. And even mentioning donations will trigger the associations people have around donations, which will steer away from the concept of unconditionally giving.

- The event is not used for marketing or promotion of any kind

> When the facilitator mentions their commercial activities at the end of an event, it alters the energy of the event. The event was not unconditionally given because the participants can't be sure that the event was not a 'free sample' to get them hooked on the service the facilitator provides.

- The event strives to be unconditional in all other economic regards.

- The event can ask for and receive (financial) gifts that were unconditionally given by the participants. It is important to frame this correctly and that no implicit expectation is created. 

> A gift is not unconditional when the participant expects it to contribute to future events.

## Organizing investment
The amount of time and energy it takes to organize an event is commonly underestimated.

Examples of what it takes to organize an event:

- Maintaining an active network of people
- Promoting the event
- Keeping up individual practice
- Financial investment in spaces
- Arranging transport for people, props & prerequisites
- Learn various challenging social and spiritual skills if the event is innovative (which in the case of UO, it often is)
- Keeping up IT infrastructure
- Preparing the event: writing, meetings, practice etc.
- Making tea & otherwise create a comfortable atmosphere for participants
- Dealing with edge-cases, no-shows and practical issues
- The list goes on...

We can conclude that there is a significant energy investment for the organizer(s). To give unconditionally in all of these areas is likely to be a challenge for the organizer.

### Compromises

Naturally, when this framework is practically adopted, there will be a push to make compromises. We would like to stress that any compromises made to this particular element should be considered with great care, as there is a very thin line where a compromise entails the change of the entire energy behind the gathering.

Which compromises should be made is entirely context-dependent.
