In this article we set a definition for _Unconditionlly Given_ as a cost type.

## Setting a definition
The idea of UO is to create a healing gathering without conditions. There are many types of conditions, ranging from the very obvious (an entry fee) to the very complex (hardly noticable subconscious conditions which has roots in personal trauma).

> Imagine an organizer who rejects certain personality types unknowingly due to youth experiences, and makes them feel less welcome. The condition for the gathering will now be: Don't be of that personality type.

While many angles at removing such conditions are already being taken (the rise of inclusivity & relating practices). We claim that these angles currently only have impact on the surface. And while that could eventually provide a bigger shift in how our gatherings are organized, UO aims to challenge the root of Western FoG by taking decommercialization as a starting point.

### Compromises

Naturally, when this framework is practically adopted, there will be a push to make compromises. We would like to stress that any compromises made to this particular element should be considered with great care, as there is a very thin line where a compromise entails the change of the entire energy behind the gathering.

Which compromises should be made is entirely context-dependent.

We actually give a definition for a decommercialized event in the spirit of unconditional giving. There is no point to decommercialize if not in this spirit, and the term 'decommercialize' sounds a bit activistic which is not what this framework is trying to achieve (although it could potentially be used that way). The practical reality of unconditional meaning no condition = no entry fee makes this term still very suitable for this way of organizing.

### Guidelines
- There is no entry fee for the gathering.

> If there is an entry fee, that will be a very obvious condition for entering the event.

- There is no implicit expectation for a donation

> Writing something like "Donations are welcome!" in the event description will alter the energy of the space. The event was not unconditionally given. People might feel ashamed if they do not donate. And even mentioning donations will trigger the associations people have around donations, which will steer away from the concept of unconditionally giving.

- The event is not used for marketing or promotion of any kind

> When the facilitator mentions their commercial activities at the end of an event, it alters the energy of the event. The event was not unconditionally given because the participants can't be sure that the event was not a 'free sample' to get them hooked on the service the facilitator provides.

## Organizing investment
The amount of time and energy it takes to organize an event is commonly underestimated.

Examples of what it takes to organize an event:

- Maintaining an active network of people
- Promoting the event
- Keeping up individual practice
- Financial investment in spaces
- Arranging transport for people, props & prerequisites
- Learn various challenging social and spiritual skills if the event is innovative (which in the case of UO, it often is)
- Keeping up IT infrastructure
- Preparing the event: writing, meetings, practice etc.
- Making tea & otherwise create a comfortable atmosphere for participants
- Dealing with edge-cases, no-shows and practical issues
- The list goes on...

We can conclude that there is a significant energy investment for the organizer(s). To give unconditionally in all of these areas is likely to be a challenge for the organizer.
