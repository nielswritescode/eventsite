Our focus is on big cities such as Berlin or Amsterdam. Reason being that:

- It is our frame of reference
- The collective awareness is relatively higher there. 

The project is written for an audience of:

- People willing to get into TIDSUO or gain an understanding of UO
- People with experience in any of the related fields (therapists, psychologists and facilitators)

The project is written in American English.

Not a singly line of the project is written by AI. AI is only used as support. 
We aim that every line can be explained and is understood by the individual who wrote it (archived by Github).
Preferably every member of the project is contactable about their contribution.

The project is open source.

The issue tracker on GitHub can be used for discussing criticism. At the start of the project, it only takes criticism from people who have a deep understanding of the subject, but as it grows, it aims to also incorporate criticism from a wider audience.

The project aims to create a broad overview of how different concepts (decommercialization, healing, unconditionality) are related in context. With such broad overview in mind, it becomes clear which concepts need to be researched and in which context. 

> If only makes sense to start researching FoG without credentials if we can see the potential for its role in unconditional organizing.

The project clearly separates examples from opinions from facts.

Since the project challenges foundational societal structures, it might need its own standards.
