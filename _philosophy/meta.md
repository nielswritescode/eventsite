Our focus is on big cities such as Berlin or Amsterdam. Reason being that:

- It is our frame of reference
- The collective awareness is relatively higher there. 

The project is written for an audience of:

- People willing to get into TIDSUO or gain an understanding of UO
- People with experience in any of the related fields (therapists, psychologists and facilitators)

The project is written in American English.

Not a singly line of the project is written by AI. AI is only used as support. 
We aim that every line can be explained and is understood by the individual who wrote it (archived by Github).
Preferably every member of the project is contactable about their contribution.
