The project is currently in a *research* phase. This phase can be split in multiple sub-phases.

*Research* phase:

1) The initiator provides their insights to enable conversation on the topic. 
2) From this conversation a community is formed to start working on the project.
3) The community sets standards.

To be continued...

This is relevant because currently we only claim that TIDSUO is worthy of research.
This claim is needed because practical experience is needed for the research.

We are willing to accept that TIDSUO might be problematic for a reason like:

- Society is not benefited by this way of organizing
- It is impossible for organizers to be integer enough to start TIDSUO 

But until good counterarguments from a place of deep understanding have been given, we continue.

We highlight a specific way of organizing: TIDSUO. TIDSUO is done by a combination of organizing without 
expectation of reciprocity and decommercialization. 
We highlight its potential benefits to:

- The here and now (what can we observe from such an event?)
- Its possible effect on the transition to unconditional organizing (which we claim to be beneficial)

Then we need to compare it to many current structures that attempt this somehow.

To make it practically realistic, we discuss taboos:
- Facilitation of gatherings without credentials
- Slightly compromising on social safety

We also discuss common challenges for this approach as well as creative solutions.
- The challenges of hosting a free event
- Alternative ways of finding spaces

And finally we need to discuss how we can move from TIDSUO to truly unconditional events
