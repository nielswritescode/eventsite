I'd like the teachers for these events to be able to be vulnerable. To be able to make mistakes and learn (the only way to learn). To allow creativity in their 
teaching. To allow them to heal from their own teaching. However:
 - Since many of these events are quite vulnerable for the participants, mistakes from the teacher could have a big negative impact on the community and destroy the philosophy as a whole.
 - The events are free, but I'd like to prove that they are not low quality (which is the common assumption when an event is free)

This means that, at the moment default is that I ask from teachers that they only host events they are confident about hosting. 

ROADMAP:!!!
For more experimental events or try-outs, an [experimental] tag will be added to the event.
