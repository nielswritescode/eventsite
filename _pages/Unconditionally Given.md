## What do I mean by this?

This event is free of charge, which means that:

- I do not charge an entry fee.
- There is no implicit expectation for a donation.

## Why is it free?

I believe that, when money gets involved, something inherently changes about the spiritual nature of the event. I could write an entire book about what that exactly is, but in order to gain enough insight to write that book, I'd need to organize many events first. 

I'll leave these 3 questions here instead:

- Would it be possible to organize events from a place of giving unconditionally?
- To what degree does your experience of an event change when there is an entry fee?
- Is there a possibility for an entirely different philosophy behind event organization?

## How to contribute

There is no expectation to contribute. Nor is it dependent on your (financial) situation. You're welcome to not do so your entire life. 

Organizing events takes my time, energy and money. I have to keep up my own practice. Learn various very challenging social and networking skills. Use my personal financial and social resources to give unconditionally. Specialize in challenging spiritual topics while also keeping my own relationships and lifestyle healthy (I'm very, very imperfect)

So if you attended one of my events, and you have found a place of unconditional giving in yourself. You could support me by: 

- A financial contribution in cash
- Sharing your top 3 skills for me to call upon
*Perhaps you're good at cleaning and you would like to clean my house. You're a massage therapist and can give me a session. You can give me a free ticket to your spiritual event. You have a car and can offer transport. You can teach me a useful skill. You're good at fixing bikes and are willing to fix mine. There are so many options.*
- Helping out with events directly. Promotion, spaceholding or other organizational tasks.
- Your creative idea on how to support me or my mission.
