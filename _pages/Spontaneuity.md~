While there is a sign-up for most of my events to: 
 - Get a sense for how many people are joining.
 - Be able to inform participants in case there are changes to the event.
 - Create a sense of commitment for both us and the participants.

...you are welcome to join spontaneously without signing up, as long as you have no expectations!

I think the ability to join an event spontaneously is important because: 
 - It allows someone to live a more spontaneous lifestyle, being more aligned with their needs in the moment.
 - It reduces stress from having a fully planned life.
 - It allows for a more flexible social life. (It's possible to invite a friend or stranger you just met to come with you last minute!)
 - It creates an open and inviting atmosphere.
 
Events have never been "full" untill now.
