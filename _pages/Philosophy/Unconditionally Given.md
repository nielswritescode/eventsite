## What do I mean by this?

This event is free of charge, which means that:

- I do not charge an entry fee.
- There is no implicit expectation for a donation.

## Why is it free?

I believe that, when money gets involved, something inherently changes about the spiritual nature of the event. I could write an entire book about what that exactly is, but in order to gain enough insight to write that book, I'd need to organize many events first. 

I'll leave these 3 questions here instead:

- Would it be possible to organize events from a place of giving unconditionally?
- To what degree does your experience of an event change when there is an entry fee?
- Is there a possibility for an entirely different philosophy behind event organization?

## What are you receiving exactly?

So, first of all, this is not meant to gaslight anyone into contributing. It is merely meant to get an understanding of what it takes to 
organize. You are receiving it unconditionally and you are worth it.

The amount of time and energy it takes to organize an event is commonly underestimated. I have ocasionally spent over 70 hours on a 2-hour workhop.

For me, organizing an event requires:

- Maintaining an active network of people
- Promoting the event
- Keeping up my own practice for anything I teach
- Investing financially in spaces
- Arranging transport for people, props & prerequisites
- Learn various challenging social and spiritual skills due to the innovative nature of my events
- Keeping up the IT infrastructure
- Preparing the event: writing, meetings, practice etc.
- Making tea & otherwise create a comfortable atmosphere for participants
- Dealing with edge-cases, no-shows and practical issues
- The list goes on...

## How to contribute

There is no expectation to contribute. Nor is it dependent on your (financial) situation. You're welcome to not do so your entire life. 

However, if you attended one of my events, and you have found a place of unconditional giving in yourself. You could support me by: 

- A financial contribution in cash
- Sharing your top 3 skills for me to call upon
*Perhaps you're good at cleaning and you would like to clean my house. You're a massage therapist and can give me a session. You can give me a free ticket to your spiritual event. You have a car and can offer transport. You can teach me a useful skill. You're good at fixing bikes and are willing to fix mine. There are so many options.*
- Helping out with events directly. Promotion, spaceholding or other organizational tasks.
- Your creative idea on how to support me or my mission.
