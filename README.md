# Project: Moving towards Unconditional Organizing. Exploring the decommercialization of healing gatherings as a first step. 
Imagine there would be an abundance of healing gatherings available every day. At zero cost, inclusive and run by highly enlightened facilitators. Gatherings with very little conditions. Spontaneous entry possible.

> You wake up on a monday and decide today you'd like to receive a massage, some somatic guidance and dance in connection with the community.

This would be the utopia of Unconditional Organizing.

There have been improvements in the spirit of UO such as the rise in collective awareness and standards on inclusivity. 

In this project, we aim to introduce a new step on the journey towards UO: the decommercialization of healing gatherings as a mindset change.

We take a look at the status quo and suggest guidelines for hosting healing gatherings from a decommercialized perspective in the spirit of UO.

This project is meant to offer legitimacy to this new perspective because it is quite distant from the status quo and therefore quickly rejected which we feel it does not deserve. We think it deserves to be taken into account non-judgementally. One could argue that the status quo is actually quite problematic and that fresh new perspectives should be received gratefully.

It also aims to build a theoretical foundation for decommercialized organizing and share knowledge and insights in order to improve together.

## What is decommercialized organizing?
It is simultaneously incredibly complicated and extremely simple.

Simple:

- Gatherings of people have an amazing potential for healing. In UO, it is
aimed to realize these without expecting anything in return.

Complicated:

- In UO, there might be huge potential for healing from collective trauma.
It will require a mindset and paradigm change. Non-dualistic thinking
and the exploring of taboos and extremes is involved(as of now). It is
currently a mountain to be moved, and this project aims to take the first
baby step.

That is what the project is going to be about! Taking small steps. Weâ€™re going to write on topics such as:

- Decommercializing gatherings
- Allowing teacher vulnerability in non-commercial gatherings
- Teaching without credentials & the link to non-commercialism
- The challenge of hosting free events

# Who are needed for this project?
