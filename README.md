# Project: Exploring the case of total decommercialization of healing gatherings in Unconditional Organizing.

Unconditional Organizing (UO) is the act of organizing a gathering or event with no conditions attached. In reality, there will always be conditions, so we see UO as a greyscale with on one end ultra-commercial gatherings and on the other end unconditional gatherings hosted by highly enlightened individuals.

In this project, we explore the specific case of total decommercialization of healing gatherings in the spirit of UO, which we'll refer to as TIDSUO.

We first make our claims:

- We do not claim that TIDSUO is 'good', or that it should be implemented. 
- We do claim that TIDSUO could have great potential for collective healing.
- We also claim that TIDSUO is a concept worthy of research. That is is worthy of discussion and to be experimented with (practical experience is needed in order to understand the concept).

Then we describe what the project aims for:

- To describe the relation of current events to UO.
- To provide a comprehensive basis of knowledge and insights so TIDSUO can be more easily discussed on a deeper level.
- To provide a framework for organizers interested in TIDSUO, allowing them to start organizing in this way and gain new insights.

This project challenges foundational societal structures, common ethics and taboos. It will therefore receive a lot of criticism. I, as the initiator, am by no way integer enough to write the whole thing. I therefore wish to write it together with a community. I think the project could gain a lot of strength when it is being worked on by many passionate individuals. This is not for the faint hearted. Are you passionate about contributing? Please do write us an e-mail.
