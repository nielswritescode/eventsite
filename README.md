title: Unconditional Events
permalink: /

Unconditional events is an independent social initiative that aims to facilitate authentic human connection at zero cost. It aims to decommercialize spirituality
and to shake off our trauma layers while being integrated in the real world. It follows our innovative, niche philosophy which we'll call
"Unconditional Event Organizing". 

The philosophy is written in the 'we' form because:
 - The entire philosophy is a very personal interaction between us (the organizers) and the participants.
 - It is meant to be presented as the view of a certain amount of people

In the sidebar you can find the events currently happening, read more about the philosophy or get to know us as organizers.

Please note that unconditional events is not a democracy as of now! This is because the initiative is in its early stages and very vulnerable.
It receives a lot of criticism which is challenging to incorporate, because it's so much. As the philosophy grows more mature, it should be able to handle more and 
integrate it healthily.
ROADMAP: Give proper arguments for this.
