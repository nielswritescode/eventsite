Unconditional events is an independent social initiative that aims to facilitate authentic human connection at zero cost.
For now, the philosophy is written in the 'I' form. As I get more experience, the philosophy grows and people join in, I will try to generalize it.

Hi! I'm Niels, and I'm attempting to realize my philosophy for organizing events unconditionally. 
It is about events one could call spiritual. However, to me they're just ways to connect to yourself, others
in authentic, creative and healing manner, whatever that might entail. Stuff that's very much needed in this world
nowadays.

In the sidebar you can find more information on the philosophy, read more about me as an organizer, find the current events happening or how to get in touch!

-Niels
