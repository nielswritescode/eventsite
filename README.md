# Project: Legitimizing a different way of organizing healing gatherings: *Unconditional Organizing* by providing a community-maintained framework.
This project aims to create a community-maintained framework for a new way
of organizing gatherings which we’ll call Unconditional Organizing(UO). The
framework should be free and accessible online and be open for suggestions
from anyone. People can adapt the framework to their own needs. The goal of
the framework is to make it easier for individuals and communities interested
in UO to organise their gatherings and provide legitimacy.
The framework will be aimed at individuals and communities, not at organizations, though this could be implemented later.

## What is UO?
It is simultaneously incredibly complicated and extremely simple.

Simple:

- Gatherings of people have an amazing potential for healing. In UO, it is
aimed to realize these without expecting anything in return.

Complicated:

- In UO, there might be huge potential for healing from collective trauma.
It will require a mindset and paradigm change. Non-dualistic thinking
and the exploring of taboos and extremes is involved(as of now). It is
currently a mountain to be moved, and this project aims to take the first
baby step.

That is what the project is going to be about! Taking small steps. We’re going to write on topics such as:

- Decommercializing gatherings
- Allowing teacher vulnerability in non-commercial gatherings
- Teaching without credentials & the link to non-commercialism
- The challenge of hosting free events

# Who are needed for this project?
Anyone with passion & who gets what this project is trying to achieve.
Relevant skills include:

- Academic writing
- Experience with event organizing
- Understanding of collective trauma
- Any kind of teaching
